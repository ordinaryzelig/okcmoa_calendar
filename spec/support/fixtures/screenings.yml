    description: ! 'For this annual event we celebrate the vibrant cinema culture
      of France during the week of La Fte Nationale. Copresented with the support
      of the Cultural Offices of the French Embassy, the Consulate General of France
      in Houston, Texas and LAlliance Franaise dOKC.

      Daniel Auteuil stars as the eponymous well-digger Pascale, a widower living
      with his six daughters in the Provence countryside at the start of World War
      I. His eldest, Patricia (Astrid Bergs-Frisbey), has returned home from Paris
      to help raise her sisters, and Pascale dreams of marrying her off to his loyal
      assistant Felipe (Kad Merad). But when shes impregnated by a wealthy young pilot
      (Nicolas Duvauchelle) who promptly abandons her for the frontlines, Pascale
      is left to contend with the consequences. An exquisitely crafted, sun-drenched
      melodrama, set to a score by Academy Award-nominee Alexandre Desplat, the film
      captures all the warmth and humanist spirit of Pagnols original work. In French
      with English subtitles.
